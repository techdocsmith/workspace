## First impressions

After I build the docs and open the landing page, I notice:
- Call to action for the trial at the top of the page.
- Prominent search bar. I'm a big search fan.
- Clean look of the tiles for the various products.
- Left nav is organized largely according to product.
- Right table of contents seems to be floating / out of place on the home page.

The site and docs feel professional in general. I'd be happy to work on it.

## Things I like

Things I like about the developer portal include:

- The welcome pages for each product with product details and **Ways to use** the product. As a developer, if I haven't chosen a specific technology, I can read to see which one best suits the problem I'm trying to solve. 
- Many services have example data sets with instructions on how to load them.
- I like the **HowTo** sections that include instructions to address specific problems I might be trying to solve. For example, "Create a real-time alerting solution" for Flink. 

## Recommendations

Some suggestions:
- How would it work to promote some solution-based content on the landing page? For example, it might be nice to have solutions oriented tiles or similar to help me quickly find the **HowTo** content that interests me. For example: [Confluent tutorials landing page](https://developer.confluent.io/tutorials/).
- I wonder if there might be a way to use some of the cleaner CSS from a topic like `docs/tools.html` in the other top-level TOC topics like `docs/products/kafka/concepts.html`. Would it be possible to add a bit of context around the list of links?
- Is there simpler style that could work for the reference pages? For example, in `docs/tools/cli/service.html` there are a lot of different styles in the first page fold: h2, h3 in preformatted/code, table with borders, table headers, inline code, bold text, hyperlinks, and code blocks.

## Working in a public repo

Some of the things I think about when working in public repos include:
- Follow the community guidelines.
- For open source content, the topic shouldn't refer to or be dependent on proprietary content or software.
- Don't publish secrets or passwords. Probably the same for internal repos, but even more so for public ones.
- Be kind and don't make biased assumptions. For example, you may not necessarily know the gender/preferred pronouns of a community contributor from their profile name.
